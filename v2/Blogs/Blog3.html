              <h2>Pac-Man Reinforcement Learning Championship</h2>
              <p>My team and I were participating in a fun Pac-Man tournament where we would tune our Pac-Man models to essentially defeat other students' Pac-Man. We used a combination of techniques like Q-learning to train our model. <br><br>So the professor set up a tournament webpage so that we could view the results of the tournament. I noticed a trend in webpages, for example:<code>ucsc.example/20231204</code> which was the date of the tournament results. So, being impatient and wanting to know my grade, I decide to try the webpage <code>ucsc.example/20231205</code> the current day to see the results. And was met with a webpage like this:</p> <figure class="image">
                    <img src="../images/phpinfo8.3.png" alt="PHP config page" class="blog-image">
                    <figcaption class="has-text-centered has-text-grey is-italic mt-2">Screenshot of the webpage config</figcaption>
              <p>Granted the page above is an example, the one I received was many times longer, which included a wealth of information that I really didn't understand the grasp of. So I decided to go check if this webpage was only accessible to me since I was a student. I used <code>dig</code> to check if the domain was publicly accessible, and it resolved an IP address. I was very interested, so I read the page to make sure I wasn't wasting their time and found interesting technologies, directory endpoints, and much more. This is what I sent to ITS.</p>   
              <figure class="image">
                <img src="../images/ITS-MESSAGE.png" alt="ITS response" class="blog-image">
                <figcaption class="has-text-centered has-text-grey is-italic mt-2">Screenshot showing ITS response</figcaption>
              </figure>
              
              <p>It might be a bit hard to see, but at the top is the response I received. The feeling of being able to help out and provide value was an invaluable experience. A few days later it was patched, and I was no longer able to see the webpage! This lit a fire in me; I wanted to do this again. Then I stumbled across Bug Bounties. </p>

              

<h3>The Beginning (Domain 1)</h3>

<p>After winter quarter I hopped right into learning some of the basics and Burp Suite. Did all of their misconfig and API labs. I felt ready to go. I started with a lesser-known domain just to start small and work my way up. The goal was just to learn and absorb how modern web applications work. As I walked through each link and request with Burp, I noticed upon clicking on a login button I received 4 sentry.io responses as I stalled the request. 2 requests were normal, with content length of 300~, but the next 2 were very interesting, as one had a content length of 200k~ and the other had around 80k~. The responses with high content lengths included a lot of info like js endpoints, blacklisted countries, etc. </p>

<p>So being kind of new I submitted this as a bug because I thought it was a significant find and possibly a misconfiguration. A response with a content length of 200k is around 160 packets if your MTU is 1500. Which I thought was significant, but I received: <strong>Although your finding might appear to be a security vulnerability, this behavior does not really pose a concrete and exploitable risk to the platform.</strong></p>




<p> So I was a bit bummed because I thought I'd just found my first bug and was thinking it was some huge find, but it taught me that although it may be a misconfiguration, it didn't cause seemingly apparent risk to the platform. Which made sense. So I sharpened up my skills and moved on. Learning from a variety of bug bounty bountiers and using their techniques and frameworks on my next domain. </p>




<h3>Domain 2</h3>

<p> I learned a bunch of new fancy tools like the importance of subdomain recon, nuclei, naabu, sqlmap, and my favorite Google dorking. With these new tools, I was more confident than ever and ready to tackle my next bounty. This new approach was focused on enumeration. I first Google dorked the target with queries like: <code>site:example.com ext:pdf</code> or things like <code>site:example.com intext:key</code></p>

<p>And I found something interesting, it was a file path named <code>example/company-scp</code>a bash script that included functions like build_tunnel(),get_ssh_cert(), and BASTION_API definitions. By its self it just seemed like a script used to establish connection for scp. So then I decided to see what the main directory looked like and it was a completly exposed directory path.</p>

<p>Now I got really excited again, so without digging any deeper I sent a report in and within hours I got another <strong>After careful review, it appears that the behavior described does not have a significant security impact on our platform. Therefore, we will be closing this report as informational.</strong></p>

<p>Once again back to the well, super bummed, but I did get a bit further and realized I was lacking big time. I was following what the people online were doing, the tools they used, and the enumeration strategies. So what was I doing wrong? </p>

<h3>The Realization</h3>

              It hit me right in the face. When I was a kid, I was very successful in sports and won many medals in soccer, basketball, and baseball. I continued to excel throughout high highschool but wasn't good enough to play in college. Now why does this matter? I'll use an analogy: in sports we are taught to get better at the things we control, like our conditioning, our positioning, footwork, shooting, etc. A crucial piece of sports was being left out on us players. We would blindly listen to coaches and do as they say since they are coaches; it wasn't really asked as to why. But this is where I lacked in, I was practicing all these fancy techniques without knowing who I was playing or fighting against. This is half the battle I was missing out on. It's not valid or effective to randomly spray and enumerate. I have to learn who I am playing against, their strengths, their weaknesses, and how they operate in order to effectively compete. Down to the server type up to the front-end frameworks, I'm missing out on so much.</p>

<p>Therfore as of right now, I've retired as I continue to learn about popular techs and document them here:  <a href="../Bug_Bounty/Bug_Bounty.html">Bug_Bounty</a>  </p> Where I will go into labbing wordpress application, sql servers, rce's, and much more to improve my play.
